# Asking Questions During the ForgeAI Hackathon

Need help, clarification, or encountering a blocker? We're here to help! To keep things organized and ensure your questions reach the mentors efficiently, please use **GitHub Issues** within **your team's assigned repository**.

## Why Use GitHub Issues?

*   **Trackable:** Everyone can see the question and its status.
*   **Asynchronous:** Ask your question anytime, and mentors can respond when available.
*   **Focused:** Keeps discussions tied to specific problems or topics.
*   **Visibility:** Helps mentors prioritize and prevents duplicate questions.
*   **Organized Triage:** Linking to the project board ensures your question gets seen!

## How to Ask a Question (Submit an Issue)

Follow these steps carefully to ensure your question is routed correctly:

1.  **Navigate to Your Repository:**
    *   Go to your team's specific project repository on `github.com`.

2.  **Open the Issues Tab:**
    *   Click on the **Issues** tab, usually located near the top of the repository page alongside "Code", "Pull requests", etc.

3.  **Create a New Issue:**
    *   Click the green **New issue** button on the right side of the Issues page.

4.  **Write a Clear Title:**
    *   Make the title a concise summary of your problem or question.
    *   *Good Examples:* `FastAPI returning 500 error on /api/v1/process`, `How to format history_data for RAG API?`, `Unsure how to add document to RAG collection`
    *   *Bad Examples:* `Help!`, `Code not working`, `Question`

5.  **Write a Detailed Description:**
    *   In the main text box ("Leave a comment"), provide details:
        *   **What are you trying to achieve?** (Your goal)
        *   **What steps did you take?**
        *   **What happened?** (Describe the actual outcome)
        *   **What did you expect to happen?**
        *   **Include relevant code snippets.** Use Markdown code blocks (```python ... ```) for formatting.
        *   **Paste specific error messages.** Use code blocks for these too.
        *   **Mention relevant files or API endpoints.**
    *   See "Tips for Effective Questions" below.

6.  **Link to the Mentors Project (CRITICAL STEP!):**
    *   Look at the **right-hand sidebar** of the "New issue" page.
    *   Find the **Projects** section.
    *   Click the gear icon ⚙️ next to "Projects".
    *   In the dropdown or search box that appears, find and select **`Q&A w/ Mentors`**.
    *   **Ensure this project is checked or added to your issue.** This is how your question gets routed to the mentors' triage board! *If you skip this step, mentors might miss your question.*

7.  **Submit the Issue:**
    *   Once you've filled everything out and **linked the project**, click the green **Submit new issue** button.

## Tips for Effective Questions

To help mentors understand and answer your questions faster:

*   **Be Specific:** Avoid vague questions. Pinpoint the problem area.
*   **Provide Context:** Which part of the template are you working on? Which endpoint or function is causing trouble?
*   **Show Your Work:** Explain what you've already tried to solve the problem. This prevents suggestions you've already tested.
*   **Use Code Blocks:** Format code snippets and error messages using Markdown triple backticks (```) for readability.
*   **Isolate the Problem:** If possible, try to reproduce the issue with the simplest possible code example.

## Important Security Note

*   **DO NOT** post sensitive information (like your `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, other passwords, or personal data) directly in GitHub Issues. These are often public or semi-public within the organization. If a mentor needs specific sensitive details, they will arrange a secure way to communicate.

## Response Times

Mentors will be actively monitoring the **`Q&A w/ Mentors`** project board during scheduled support hours. They will triage and respond to issues as quickly as possible. Please be patient, especially during busy periods. Check the issue for comments and updates.
